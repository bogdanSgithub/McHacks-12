# Inspiration
MyFridge was inspired by the need to minimize food waste. We wanted to create an app to help users track their food inventory, manage expiry dates, and suggest recipes based on what they have in their fridge.

# What it does
The app allows users to:
- Add food items by scanning the receipt
- Track expiry dates and receive reminders when ingredients are nearing expiration
- Track the stock and inventory of ingredients
- Get recipe suggestions based on available ingredients to use up food before it goes to waste

# How we built it
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite  
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, OpenAI API  
- **Database:** SQLite  

# Challenges we ran into
- Building a real-time inventory system and dynamically suggesting recipes based on available ingredients  
- Making the app user-friendly while managing backend logic efficiently  

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We integrated a web scraper that extracts information from receipts using OCR parsing.

# What we learned
- Efficient web scraping and receipt parsing  
- Managing a database with SQLite  
- Creating a dynamic frontend using React and TypeScript  

# What's next for MyFridge
- Adding features like meal planning and shopping list integration  
- Developing a more advanced recipe recommendation engine  
- Enhancing the UI for a more interactive experience
- Support other grocery stores

# Built With
